# Modified X-0  (Tic-Tac-Toe)

This is an university project for the subject: Artificial Inteligence.

It is a game of X-0. The player can choose the board's dimensions, one of two bot AIs and a symbol ( X/0 ).

##Game rules:

- The board dimensions have to be: odd number vertically and even number horizontally.
- At the start of the game, there will be two symbols (one of each) already places in the middle of the board.
- No matter what symbol is chosen by the player, X is always the first to make a move.
- The last symbol places by each of the players will be marked by a change of color (green).
- The player and the bot take turns placing new symbols on the board. A new symbol can be placed 1 block away from the last one (the green one). The distance can be vertical, horizontal or diagonal.
